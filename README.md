# Customer Segmentation Project Documentation


This project aims to segment customers into distinct groups using clustering techniques, primarily K-Means. Customer segmentation helps businesses understand the different behaviors within their customer base, enabling them to tailor marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and enhance overall business efficiency.

The dataset used in this project contains customer information from a mall, including features such as age, annual income, and spending score.effectively.

## Objectives
- To cluster customers based on their purchasing behavior and other demographic attributes.
- To visualize the customer clusters using K-Means.
- To evaluate the clustering performance using inertia and silhouette scores.




## Key Features:


- K-Means Clustering: The project uses the K-Means algorithm for customer segmentation, which groups customers based on features such as annual income, age, and spending score.
- Elbow Method: The elbow method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters by plotting the cost function (inertia) for different values of K.
- Cluster Visualization: Visualizes clusters in 2D scatter plots, showing how customers are grouped based on selected features.
- Cluster Evaluation: Evaluates clusters using metrics such as inertia and silhouette scores to ensure the segmentation is meaningful.



## Project Workflow
    1. Importing Libraries
    We first import the necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and KMeans from sklearn.

    2. Loading Dataset
    The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for data manipulation..

    3. Elbow Method to Find Optimal Clusters
    We use the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters by plotting the inertia (cost function) for different values of K. This helps in selecting the right number of clusters that minimize the cost without overfitting.

    4. K-Means Clustering
    The K-Means algorithm is applied to the dataset using a specified number of clusters. We perform clustering on different feature sets like:

    Feature Set 1: Annual Income vs. Spending Score
    Feature Set 2: Age vs. Annual Income
    Feature Set 3: Age vs. Spending Score.

    5. Cluster Evaluation
    The quality of the clusters is evaluated using the inertia (cost function) and the silhouette score, which provides an estimate of how well-defined the clusters are..

    6. Visualizing Clusters
    We plot 2D scatter plots to visualize the clusters and the centroids (cluster centers). This helps us interpret the customer segments and understand their behavior patterns.

    7. Silhouette Score
    The silhouette score is used to measure the similarity of an object to its own cluster compared to other clusters. A higher silhouette score indicates well-separated clusters.
